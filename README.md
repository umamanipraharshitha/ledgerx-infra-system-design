# 🚀 LedgerX(ONGOING)

### Distributed Subscription & Payment Infrastructure for SaaS Platforms

LedgerX is a **scalable, multi-tenant financial infrastructure platform** that enables SaaS companies to integrate **authentication, subscriptions, usage-based billing, API rate limiting, and real-time revenue analytics** with strong guarantees around **correctness, security, and fault tolerance**.

The system is designed using **industry-standard distributed system patterns** inspired by real-world architectures at **Stripe, AWS, Razorpay, and Auth0**.

Continuous Integration & Deployment

LedgerX uses a CI/CD pipeline to ensure safe, reliable, and repeatable deployments.

Pull requests trigger automated testing and validation

Each service has an independent pipeline

Staging deployments are automatic

Production deployments require manual approval

Secrets are managed via environment-based configuration

This pipeline design mirrors real-world financial systems where correctness and safety are prioritized over rapid deployment.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Modern SaaS products require:

* Secure authentication and authorization
* Subscription and usage-based billing
* Accurate money handling (no double charges)
* Scalable API access with rate limits
* Real-time revenue and usage analytics
* Fault-tolerant payment processing

Most startups either:

* Build fragile, tightly coupled systems
* Or rely on multiple third-party services with limited control

**LedgerX solves this by acting as a unified backend infrastructure layer**.

---

## 🎯 Core Objectives

* **Correctness over convenience** (ledger-based accounting)
* **Horizontal scalability**
* **Strong security boundaries**
* **Failure-aware design**
* **Multi-tenant isolation**
* **Production-ready architecture**

---

## 🧱 Core System Components

### 1️⃣ Identity & Access Service

Handles user authentication, authorization, and tenant isolation.

**Features**

* Email/password authentication
* OAuth (Google)
* JWT access tokens (short-lived)
* Refresh token rotation
* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
* Multi-tenant user isolation

**Why**

* Stateless authentication enables horizontal scaling
* Short-lived tokens reduce blast radius of leaks

---

### 2️⃣ Subscription & Billing Engine

Manages plan lifecycle and billing logic.

**Capabilities**

* Free, Pro, Enterprise plans
* Monthly / yearly billing
* Usage-based billing
* Grace periods & retries
* Plan upgrades & downgrades
* Proration calculation

**Key Design Choice**
Billing logic is **decoupled from payment events** to avoid tight coupling with Stripe.

---

### 3️⃣ Payment Processing Service

Responsible for all external payment interactions.

**Responsibilities**

* Stripe Checkout integration
* Secure webhook verification
* Idempotent event handling
* Retry-safe processing
* Failure reconciliation

**Why**
Stripe webhooks are **eventually consistent** and may arrive multiple times — correctness is guaranteed through idempotency and ledger writes.

---

### 4️⃣ 🔐 Financial Ledger System (Core Component)

Implements an **immutable accounting ledger**.

**Principles**

* Append-only writes
* No updates or deletes
* All balances are derived
* Fully auditable

**Why Ledger-Based Design**

* Prevents double spending
* Enables refunds & chargebacks
* Matches real banking systems
* Simplifies auditing and reconciliation

---

### 5️⃣ API Gateway & Rate Limiting

Controls access to tenant APIs.

**Features**

* API keys per tenant
* Token-bucket rate limiting
* Plan-based quotas
* Burst protection

**Implementation**

* Redis-backed counters
* O(1) request evaluation
* Graceful degradation

---

### 6️⃣ Real-Time Analytics Engine

Provides live updates for dashboards.

**Includes**

* Active users
* Revenue metrics
* API usage
* Subscription events

**Tech**

* WebSockets / Server-Sent Events
* Event-driven updates

---

### 7️⃣ Admin & Operations Panel

Operational controls for platform admins.

**Capabilities**

* Tenant suspension
* Plan overrides
* Webhook replay
* Ledger audit inspection
* System health monitoring

---

## 📊 Scaling Strategy

| Layer     | Strategy                     |
| --------- | ---------------------------- |
| Frontend  | CDN + edge caching           |
| Backend   | Stateless horizontal scaling |
| Database  | Indexing + read replicas     |
| Cache     | Redis clustering             |
| Payments  | Async webhook queues         |
| Analytics | Event-driven processing      |

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

* HTTP-only cookies
* CSRF protection
* Encrypted secrets
* Stripe webhook signature verification
* API key rotation
* Per-tenant data isolation
* Rate-limited auth endpoints

---

## 🧪 Failure Handling

* Duplicate webhooks → Idempotency keys
* Partial payment failures → Ledger reconciliation
* Redis outage → Graceful degradation
* Network failures → Retry with backoff
* Inconsistent states → Event replay
